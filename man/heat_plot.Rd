\title{Heat plot of posterior probabilities}
\usage{
heat_plot(model_fit, burnin = model_fit$burnin, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_fit}{An object of type \code{BayesMallows}, returned from
\code{\link{compute_mallows}}.}

\item{burnin}{A numeric value specifying the number of iterations
to discard as burn-in. Defaults to \code{x$burnin}, and must be
provided if \code{x$burnin} does not exist. See \code{\link{assess_convergence}}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed on to other methods. In particular,
\code{type = "CP"} or \code{type = "MAP"} can be passed on to
\code{\link{compute_consensus}} to determine the order of items along the
horizontal axis.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object.
}
\description{
Generates a heat plot with items in their consensus ordering along the
horizontal axis and ranking along the vertical axis. The color denotes
posterior probability.
}
\examples{
model_fit <- compute_mallows(potato_visual)
model_fit$burnin <- 1000

heat_plot(model_fit)

# Items are ordered along the horizontal axis according to the ordering
# returned by compute_consensus, whose default argument is type="CP". We
# can change this, although in this case it makes no difference.

heat_plot(model_fit, type = "MAP")
