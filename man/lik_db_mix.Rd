\title{Likelihood and log-likelihood evaluation for a Mallows mixture model}
\usage{
lik_db_mix(rho, alpha, weights, metric, rankings, obs_freq = NULL, log = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{rho}{A matrix of size \code{n_clusters x n_items} whose rows are
permutations of the first n_items integers corresponding to the modal
rankings of the Mallows mixture components.}

\item{alpha}{A vector of \code{n_clusters} non-negative scalar specifying the
scale (precision) parameters of the Mallows mixture components.}

\item{weights}{A vector of \code{n_clusters} non-negative scalars specifying
the mixture weights.}

\item{metric}{Character string specifying the distance measure to use.
Available options are \code{"kendall"}, \code{"cayley"}, \code{"hamming"},
\code{"ulam"} for \code{n_items<=95}, \code{"footrule"} for
\code{n_items<=50} and \code{"spearman"} for \code{n_items<=14}.}

\item{rankings}{A matrix with observed rankings in each row.}

\item{obs_freq}{A vector of observation frequencies (weights) to apply to
each row in \code{rankings}. This can speed up computation if a large
number of assessors share the same rank pattern. Defaults to \code{NULL},
which means that each row of \code{rankings} is multiplied by 1. If
provided, \code{obs_freq} must have the same number of elements as there
are rows in \code{rankings}, and \code{rankings} cannot be \code{NULL}.}

\item{log}{A logical; if TRUE, the log-likelihood value is returned. Default
is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
The likelihood or the log-likelihood value corresponding to one or
  more observed complete rankings under the Mallows mixture rank model with
  distance specified by the \code{metric} argument.
}
\description{
Compute either the likelihood or the log-likelihood value of the
  Mallows mixture model parameters for a dataset of complete rankings.
