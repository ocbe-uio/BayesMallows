\title{Checking for Label Switching in the Mallows Mixture Model}
\description{
Label switching may sometimes be a problem when running mixture models.
The algorithm by Stephens \insertCite{Stephens2000}{BayesMallows}, implemented
in the \code{label.switching} package \insertCite{Papastamoulis2016}{BayesMallows}, allows
assessment of label switching after MCMC. At the moment, this is the only avaiable option
in the \code{BayesMallows} package. The Stephens algorithms requires the individual cluster
probabilities of each assessor to be saved in each iteration of the MCMC algorithm. As this
potentially requires much memory, the current implementation of \code{\link{compute_mallows}}
saves these cluster probabilities to a csv file in each iteration. The example below shows how
to perform such a check for label switching in practice.

Beware that this functionality is under development. Later releases might let the user
determine the directory and filenames of the csv files.
