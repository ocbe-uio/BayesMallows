This package provides a general framework for analyzing rank and
preference data based on the Bayesian Mallows model.

## Installation

To install the current release, use

``` r
install.packages("BayesMallows")
```

To install the current development version, use

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ocbe-uio/BayesMallows")
```

## Basic Usage Example

To get started, load the package with

``` r
library(BayesMallows)
set.seed(123)
```

The package comes with several example datasets. The simplest one
contains 12 persons’ assessments of the weights of 20 potatoes, either
by visual inspection (`potato_visual`) or by lifting the potatoes and
comparing their relative weights by hand (`potato_weighing`).

### Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm

To fit a Bayesian Mallows model on the `potato_visual` dataset using the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm first described in Vitelli et al.
([2018](#ref-vitelli2018)), we do

``` r
potato_data <- setup_rank_data(potato_visual)
fit <- compute_mallows(data = potato_data)
```

Next, we can see a diagnostic plot for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
with `assess_convergence()`. The plot below is for the scale parameter,
which measures the variation between the individual rankings.

``` r
assess_convergence(fit)
```

Setting the burnin to 500, we obtain a plot of the posterior
distribution of the scale parameter with:

``` r
fit$burnin <- 500
plot(fit)
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

For more examples, please see our [the introductory
vignette](https://ocbe-uio.github.io/BayesMallows/articles/BayesMallows.html),
and the function documentation. The use of parallel chains are described
in [this
vignette](https://ocbe-uio.github.io/BayesMallows/articles/parallel_chains.html).

### Sequential Monte Carlo Algorithm

The package also supports updating a Bayesian Mallows model using
sequential Monte Carlo, with the algorithm described in Stein
([2023](#ref-steinSequentialInferenceMallows2023)). For example, in
order to update the model fitted above with the potato ranks based on
comparing their relative weights by hand, we do

``` r
new_data <- setup_rank_data(rankings = potato_weighing)
updated_fit <- update_mallows(model = fit, new_data = new_data)
```

We can go on to plot the posterior distribution of the scale parameter
for this updated model.

``` r
plot(updated_fit)
```

![](man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

Sequential Monte Carlo can typically be useful when new data arrives in
batches, as it does not require the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to be
rerun. See [this
vignette](https://ocbe-uio.github.io/BayesMallows/articles/SMC-Mallows.html)
for more information.

## The Bayesian Mallows Model

### Methodology

The BayesMallows package currently implements the complete model
described in Vitelli et al. ([2018](#ref-vitelli2018)), which includes a
large number of distance metrics, handling of missing ranks and pairwise
comparisons, and clustering of users with similar preferences. The
extension to non-transitive pairwise comparisons by Crispino et al.
([2019](#ref-crispino2019)) is also implemented. In addition, the
partition function of the Mallows model can be estimated using the
importance sampling algorithm of Vitelli et al.
([2018](#ref-vitelli2018)) and the asymptotic approximation of Mukherjee
([2016](#ref-mukherjee2016)). For a review of ranking models in general,
see Liu, Crispino, et al. ([2019](#ref-liu2019)). Crispino and
Antoniano-Villalobos ([2022](#ref-crispino2022)) outlines how
informative priors can be used within the model.

Updating of the posterior distribution based on new data, using
sequential Monte Carlo methods, is implemented and described in [a
separate
vignette](https://ocbe-uio.github.io/BayesMallows/articles/SMC-Mallows.html).
The computational algorithms are described in further detail in Stein
([2023](#ref-steinSequentialInferenceMallows2023)).

### Applications

Among the current applications, Liu, Reiner, et al.
([2019](#ref-liu2019b)) applied the Bayesian Mallows model for providing
personalized recommendations based on clicking data, and Barrett and
Crispino ([2018](#ref-barrett2018)) used the model of Crispino et al.
([2019](#ref-crispino2019)) to analyze listeners’ understanding of
music. Eliseussen, Fleischer, and Vitelli
([2022](#ref-eliseussenRankbasedBayesianVariable2022)) presented an
extended model for variable selection in genome-wide transcriptomic
analyses.

### Future Extensions

Plans for future extensions of the package include implementation of a
variational Bayes algorithm for approximation the posterior
distribution. The sequential Monte Carlo algorithms will also be
extended to cover a larger part of the model framework, and we will add
more options for specifications of prior distributions.

## Compilation with Thread Building Blocks (TBB)

Parts of the underlying C++ code can be easily parallelized. We have
support for this through [oneAPI Threading Building
Blocks](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB). If you want to make use
of this, build the package from source with the `-ltbb` argument. On an
M1 Mac this can be achieved by first installing TBB through
`brew install tbb` and then adding the following line to
`~/.R/Makevars`:

``` sh
CXX17=g++-13 -I/opt/homebrew/include -L/opt/homebrew/lib -ltbb
```

The arguments on other platforms should be similar. If TBB is not
available, the package will fall back on sequential processing.
