# BayesMallows

[![CRAN\_Status\_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/BayesMallows)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BayesMallows)
[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/ocbe-uio/BayesMallows/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ocbe-uio/BayesMallows/actions)

This package provides a general framework for analyzing rank and
preference data based on the Bayesian Mallows model first described in
[Vitelli et al.(2018)](https://jmlr.org/papers/v18/15-481.html).

## Installation

To install the current release, use

``` r
install.packages("BayesMallows")
```

To install the current development version, use

``` r
#install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ocbe-uio/BayesMallows")

# Set build_vignettes to TRUE to also get the package vignettes
remotes::install_github("ocbe-uio/BayesMallows", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Basic Usage Example

To get started, load the package with

``` r
library(BayesMallows)
```

The package comes with several example datasets. The simplest one
contains 12 persons’ assessments of the weights of 20 potatoes, either
by visual inspection (`potato_visual`) or by lifting the potatoes and
comparing their relative weights by hand (`potato_weighing`). To fit a
Bayesian Mallows model on the `potato_visual` dataset, we do

``` r
fit <- compute_mallows(potato_visual)
```

Next, we can see a diagnostic plot for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm
with `assess_convergence()`. The plot below is for the scale parameter,
which measures the variation between the individual rankings.

``` r
assess_convergence(fit)
```

Setting the burnin to 500, we obtain a plot of the posterior
distribution of the scale parameter with:

``` r
plot(fit, burnin = 500)
```

et al. (2020), and the function documentation. The vignette can be
opened by issuing the following command.

## The Bayesian Mallows Model

### Methodology

The BayesMallows package currently implements the complete model
described in Vitelli et al. (2018), which includes a large number of
distance metrics, handling of missing ranks and pairwise comparisons,
and clustering of users with similar preferences. The extension to
non-transitive pairwise comparisons by Crispino et al. (2019) is also
implemented. In addition, the partition function of the Mallows model
can be estimated using the importance sampling algorithm of Vitelli et
al. (2018) and the asymptotic approximation of Mukherjee (2016). For a
review of ranking models in general, see Q. Liu et al. (2019b). Crispino
and Antoniano-Villalobos (2019) outlines how informative priors can be
used within the model.

Updating of the posterior distribution based on new data, using
sequential Monte Carlo methods, is implemented and described in a
separate vignette which can be shown with the command
`vignette("SMC-Mallows")`.

### Applications

Among the current applications, Q. Liu et al. (2019a) applied the
Bayesian Mallows model for providing personalized recommendations based
on clicking data, and Barrett and Crispino (2018) used the model of
Crispino et al. (2019) to analyze listeners’ understanding of music.

### Future Extensions

Plans for future extensions of the package include allowing for analysis
of time-varying ranks as described in Asfaw et al. (2016), and
implementation of a variational Bayes algorithm for approximation the
posterior distribution. The sequential Monte Carlo algorithms will also
be extended to cover a larger part of the model framework.
