#' Observation frequencies in the Bayesian Mallows model
#'
#' When more than one assessor have given the exact same rankings or preferences,
#' considerable speed-up can be obtained by providing only the unique set of
#' rankings/preferences to [compute_mallows()], and instead providing
#' the number of assessors in the `obs_freq` argument. This topic is illustrated
#' here. See also the function [rank_freq_distr()] for how to easily compute
#' the observation frequencies.
