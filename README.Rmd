This package provides a general framework for analyzing rank and preference data based on the Bayesian Mallows model first described in @vitelli2018.

## Installation

To install the current release, use

```{r,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("BayesMallows")
```

To install the current development version, use

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ocbe-uio/BayesMallows")

# Set build_vignettes to TRUE to also get the package vignettes
remotes::install_github("ocbe-uio/BayesMallows", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Basic Usage Example

To get started, load the package with

```{r}
library(BayesMallows)
```

The package comes with several example datasets. The simplest one contains 12 persons' assessments of the weights of 20 potatoes, either by visual inspection (`potato_visual`) or by lifting the potatoes and comparing their relative weights by hand (`potato_weighing`). To fit a Bayesian Mallows model on the `potato_visual` dataset, we do

```{r}
fit <- compute_mallows(potato_visual)
```

Next, we can see a diagnostic plot for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with `assess_convergence()`. The plot below is for the scale parameter, which measures the variation between the individual rankings.

```{r}
assess_convergence(fit)
```

Setting the burnin to 500, we obtain a plot of the posterior distribution of the scale parameter with:

```{r}
plot(fit, burnin = 500)
```


For more examples, please see the vignette, which is based on @sorensen2020, and the function documentation. The vignette can be opened by issuing the following command.

```{r,eval=FALSE}

```

## The Bayesian Mallows Model

### Methodology

The BayesMallows package currently implements the complete model described in @vitelli2018, which includes a large number of distance metrics, handling of missing ranks and pairwise comparisons, and clustering of users with similar preferences. The extension to non-transitive pairwise comparisons by @crispino2019 is also implemented. In addition, the partition function of the Mallows model can be estimated using the importance sampling algorithm of @vitelli2018 and the asymptotic approximation of @mukherjee2016. For a review of ranking models in general, see @liu2019. @crispino2022 outlines how informative priors can be used within the model. 

Updating of the posterior distribution based on new data, using sequential Monte Carlo methods, is implemented and described in a separate vignette which can be shown with the following command. The computational algorithms are described in further detail in @steinSequentialInferenceMallows2023.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vignette("SMC-Mallows")
```


### Applications

Among the current applications, @liu2019b applied the Bayesian Mallows model for providing personalized recommendations based on clicking data, and @barrett2018 used the model of @crispino2019 to analyze listeners' understanding of music. @eliseussenRankbasedBayesianVariable2022 presented an extended model for variable selection in genome-wide transcriptomic analyses.

### Future Extensions

Plans for future extensions of the package include implementation of a variational Bayes algorithm for approximation the posterior distribution. The sequential Monte Carlo algorithms will also be extended to cover a larger part of the model framework, and we will add more options for specifications of prior distributions.
