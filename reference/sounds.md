# Sounds data

Data from an experiment in which 46 individuals compared 12 different
sounds (Barrett and Crispino 2018) . Each assessor was asked multiple
times to compare a pair of two sounds, indicating which of the sounds
sounded the most like it was human generated. The pairwise preference
for each assessor are in general non-transitive. These data inspired the
Mallows model for non-transitive pairwise preferences developed by
(Crispino et al. 2019) .

## Usage
